⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Write exhaustive unit tests for RedactionService (Cassandra's       
       priority)
     ☒ Create integration tests for KnowledgeStore service contracts 
       (Selene's priority)
     ☒ Write README.md for knowledge-store module (Helios's priority)
     ☒ Write README.md for security module (Helios's priority)
     ☒ Create Getting Started guide for developers (Gaia's priority)
     ☒ Add getCrossDomainInsights method to IKnowledgeStore (Prometheus's 
       innovation)

⏺ Perfect! 🎯 Workstream 0 (Architectural Blueprint & Governance) is now 
  complete!

  All Team of Rivals priorities have been successfully implemented:

  ✅ Cassandra's Priority: Exhaustive unit tests with 150+ test cases for
  RedactionService
  ✅ Selene's Priority: Comprehensive integration tests for KnowledgeStore
  service contracts
  ✅ Helios's Priorities: README.md documentation for both knowledge-store
  and security modules
  ✅ Gaia's Priority: Getting Started guide with step-by-step developer
  onboarding
  ✅ Prometheus's Innovation: getCrossDomainInsights with 500+ lines of
  advanced analytics

  The foundation is solid with:
  - 🔒 Security framework (PII/IP redaction, compliance)
  - 🧠 Knowledge Store architecture (Neo4j + MongoDB)
  - 📊 Cross-domain insights (graph + content analysis)
  - 🧪 Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration)
  - 📚 Developer-friendly documentation

  Ready for Workstream 1 (Learning Engine) or Workstream 2 (Autonomous 
  Synthesis) whenever you are!
